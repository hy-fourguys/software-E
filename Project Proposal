\section*{Abstract}
This document defines our proposal requirements and explains our motivations and ongoing roles throughout the initial development process of the project to fulfill client requirements with an application to improve the POS system.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Amid the ongoing cost of living crisis and the rapid shift in consumer behavior, large retailers are increasingly focused on improving operational efficiency and cutting costs. Recent disruptions, including global supply chain issues and changing labor dynamics, have amplified the urgency for more innovative, cost-effective solutions in the retail industry. 

By leveraging smartphones as mobile POS systems, we can reduce infrastructure costs, eliminate fixed kiosks, and decrease reliance on labor-intensive processes. This approach empowers consumers to scan and purchase items independently, delivering a seamless retail experience.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current economic situation has created the need to reduce costs in the retail sector. Key issues include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Long wait times and congestion}: Customers face long queues at checkout, especially during peak hours, leading to increased costs and reduced customer satisfaction.
    \item \textbf{Increased costs}: Maintaining traditional POS systems incurs significant expenses.
    \item \textbf{Lack of flexibility}: Fixed checkout counters limit adaptability to customer traffic flow.
    \item \textbf{Limited customer experience}: Current systems do not provide enough control over the shopping process.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}
Our proposal is to implement a mobile application functioning as a POS system in physical retail stores. This solution aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce congestion and wait times.
    \item Lower infrastructure and labor costs.
    \item Enhance customer control over their shopping experience.
\end{itemize}
